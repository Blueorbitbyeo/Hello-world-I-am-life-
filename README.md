Life Is Discovering
Life and living is love
Love is not an emotion, though felt it transcends the ordinary, 
Love is life, it is in creation, love is Mother Nature 
Love is faith, the belief in Jesus, that he is God and whosoever believe in Him shall not be condemned but will have eternal life, a life of rest
He came as his son through divinity as salvation to humanity 
Love is why we're here, God is Love, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. 
Love is the reason God created the universe, for out of love he created us with his own hands and breathe himself into us 
Love is kindness, it is peace, it is in forgiveness and is eternal
